# Melawai Arcology

**Melawai Arcology** is the first crypto-poet’s union in Jakarta, or maybe in Indonesia. When this union was formed, the world had entered the end of 2021 and the pandemic hadn’t yet shown its end. Many of us have lost our jobs. We then gathered in Blok M and started a small slam poem, just to remember our old dream: to become a poet. One of us suggested started making money using an internet platform. Although not everyone agrees, we don't have much choice in a world where poetry isn't considered as an important thing. Hopefully in the future, when someone opens this page, arcology will be established in Blok M and the world will be better.

### **Jalan Melawai (Melawai Street)**
In the '80s, Blok M was a hang-out place for metropolitan teenagers who were also known as ABG (Anak Baru Gede) in Jakarta. At that time, Blok M was the only place that had a modern shopping center or adjacent mall, namely Pasaraya, Blok M Mall, Pasar Mayestik, and Pasar Melawai. Teenagers, most of whom are still in high school, usually hang out in that area from the afternoon to evening.

This area has become a social image of the capital's teenagers, including Jalan Melawai. Filmmakers and video clip producers are flocking to make this area their business target. Popular teen films such as “Lupus” and “Olga Sepatu Roda” were shot there, even Denny Malik and several musicians made video clip there.

The '80s marked the flourishing of capitalism in Jakarta, and Jalan Melawai holds that memory well: the noise of development, falling oil prices and banking liberalization, intrigue, and authoritarianism, all benefiting the newly born rich. On the other side, some fringe people and workers struggle with the hustle and bustle of the streets, only being treated like cash cows. And between these two opposite sides lies a naive teenager who doesn't know what the world will be like in the future; What will 2021 be like?

We have arrived in 2021, although Melawai Street has passed its golden age now, the situation there hasn't changed much.
